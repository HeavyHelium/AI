# Shortest Hamiltonian Path

The program generates N points on a 2D plane and aims to find the Shortest Hamiltonian Path defined by the points(and euclidean distance) using a genetic algorithm.

## How to run

- Compile

```sh
g++ solution.cpp -std=c++17 -o a.out
```

- To run in input mode, i.e. the user inputs the number of cities **N**

```sh
./a.out
```

- To run in test mode

```sh
./a.out test
```
