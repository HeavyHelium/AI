# Basic facts & definitions 

* ***AI*** is a broad term that refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
    * involves the development of systems or algorithms that can perrform atsks that typically require human intelligence
        * such as speech recognition, decision-making, problem-solvong, and natural language processing 
    
* ML(machine learning)  $\subseteq$ AI 
    * focuses on enabling computers to learn and make predictions wothout being explicity programmed 
    * ML algorithms allow systems to automatically learn and improve from experience or data 
        * they are trained to identify patterns, make predictions, or perform tasks  

* ***DL(deep learning) $\subseteq$ ML $\subseteq$ AI***  
    * Utilizes ***artificial neural networks*** inspired by the structure and function of the human brain 
        * involves training neural networks with multiple layers(hence the term 'deep') to learn and extract hierarchal represenatations of data  
    * Highly successful in image recognitioin, natural language processing, and speech recognition 



## Important AI algorithms 

***1. Linear Regression***  
Linear dependency between random variables -- the predictor(X, independent variable) and the observed variable(Y, dependent variable)    
Forms the basis for more complex algorithms and is widely used in predictive analytics      

***2. Logistic Regression***   
Used for binary classification problems, where the otcome is either yes or no, true or false, etc.   
It estimated probabilities of different outcomes based on input features    

***3. Decision Trees***   
Popular algorithms for both **classification and regression tasks**   

***4. Random forests***  
Ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions   
Helps reduce overfitting and impoves generalization performance   

***5. Support Vector Machines(SVM)***
Powerful algorithm used for both **classification and regression**   
Finds the best possible decision boundary that spearates different classes or predicts continuous values by maximizing the margin between data points   

***6. Naive Bayes***   
A simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks   
Based on the Bayes formula(theorem) and assumes independence among features   
Simple yet useful, many practical applications   

***7. K-nearest neighbors(KNN)***   
**Non-paramentric** algorithm used for both **classification and regression**    

***8. Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)***  
Inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain   
Consist of interconnected nodes(neurons) organized in layers    
Deep learning utilizes neural networks with many hidden layers for more complex tasks such as image and speech recognition   

***9. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)***  
Specialized type of neural networks commonly used for analyzing visual data  
Employ convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchal representations and patterns in images, making them highly effective for tasks like object detection and image classification  

***10. Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN)***  
RNNs are designed to handle sequential data, such as time series or natural language processing tasks   
They have recurrent connections that allow information to persist over time making them suitable for taks like language translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis
