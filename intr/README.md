# Basic facts & definitions 

* ***AI*** is a broad term that refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines 
    * involves the development of systems or algorithms that can perrform atsks that typically require human intelligence
        * such as speech recognition, decision-making, problem-solvong, and natural language processing 
    
* ML(machine learning)  $\subseteq$ AI 
    * focuses on enabling computers to learn and make predictions wothout being explicity programmed 
    * ML algorithms allow systems to automatically learn and improve from experience or data 
        * they are trained to identify patterns, make predictions, or perform tasks  

* ***DL(deep learning) $\subseteq$ ML $\subseteq$ AI***  
    * Utilizes ***artificial neural networks*** inspired by the structure and function of the human brain 
        * involves training neural networks with multiple layers(hence the term 'deep') to learn and extract hierarchal represenatations of data  
    * Highly successful in image recognitioin, natural language processing, and speech recognition
