# N Queens

On an **NxN** chess board place **N** queens so that no two queens share the same row, column or diagonal.  
Use the **_MinConflicts_** algorithm to solve the problem.

### IO

- Input: **N**
- Output: the board; denote a queen with '\*' and an empty cell with '\_'

($\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$)[$n \neq 2 \land n \neq 3 \iff n$-queens has a solution]
